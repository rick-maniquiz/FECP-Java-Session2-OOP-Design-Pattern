## Project Description

This project is a command-line based cryptocurrency exchange simulation built in Java. It allows users to manage a virtual wallet, buy and sell various digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, and manage their digital cash balance. The system demonstrates key object-oriented programming principles, including abstraction, inheritance, and design patterns like the Factory and Strategy patterns to handle different transaction types and asset creation.
